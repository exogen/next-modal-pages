# Next.js Modal Pages Demo

```
$ yarn
$ yarn start
```

#### NOTES

- You probably want to implement this in a more “official” React way.
  `useEffect` should probably be involved instead of updating refs during
  render.
- You’ll want a way to specify that some page transitions replace the top of
  the stack instead of them all stacking.
